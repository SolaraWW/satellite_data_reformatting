# Satellite Data Pre-Processing

Pre-processes remote sensing data on global temperature brightness and soil moisture variables obtained on satellite missions SMOS, SMAP, and GLDAS for 2013-2015 so that all remote sensing data is consistently formatted on a standard spatial EASE (Equal-Area Scaleable Earth) grid, allowing for more convenient compilation as a single composite training set.
